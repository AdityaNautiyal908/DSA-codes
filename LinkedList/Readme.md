# Linked List Implementation

This project is a simple implementation of a linked list data structure in C programming language. Linked lists are linear data structures where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence.

## Introduction

A linked list is a collection of nodes where each node contains a data element and a reference (link) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists offer dynamic memory allocation, efficient insertion and deletion operations, and variable size.

## Features

- **Dynamic Size:** Linked lists allow for dynamic memory allocation, meaning elements can be added or removed without predefined size constraints.

- **Efficient Insertion/Deletion:** Insertion and deletion operations are efficient in linked lists as they involve updating pointers, rather than shifting elements like in arrays.


## Usage

This linked list implementation provides functions to perform common operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching. Here are some example usage scenarios:

1. **Insertion:** Insert a new element into the linked list at the beginning, end, or at a specific position.

2. **Deletion:** Remove an element from the linked list based on its value or position.

3. **Traversal:** Traverse the linked list to display its elements.

4. **Searching:** Search for a specific element in the linked list.
